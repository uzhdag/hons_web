                            <span style="width:500px;">Networks are used as the most common mathematical abstraction to describe a wide variety of complex systems.	In many situations, however, it is not enough to describe the pairwise interactions between units, as the fundamental interactions involves more than a pair of elements simultaneously. Unfortunately, the vast majority of available data lacks this kind of higher-order information, and are composed only of pairwise projections. Here we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian approach that reconstructs the higher-order interactions given only network data. Our method is based on the principle of parsimony, and does not needlessly reconstruct higher-order structures when there is no statistical evidence available. We demonstrate that our approach successfully uncovers higher-order interactions in synthetic and empirical network data.

                                    <span style="width:500px;">
                                        Network analysis has typically examined the formation of whole networks while neglecting variation within or across networks. These approaches neglect the particular roles actors may adopt within networks. While cross-sectional approaches for inferring latent roles exist, there is a paucity of approaches for considering roles in longitudinal networks. This talk explores the conceptual dynamics of temporally observed roles while deriving and introducing a novel statistical tool, the ego-TERGM, capable of uncovering these latent dynamics. Estimated through an Expectation–Maximization algorithm, the ego-TERGM is quick and accurate in classifying roles within a broader temporal network. An application to data on interstate military alliances highlights the model's utility.

                                    <span style="width:500px;">Abstract: Over the past decades, methods and concepts of differential topology were used in classical statistical mechanics to describe phase transitions. In parallel, methods of stochastic topology were used to generalize the so-called giant component transition to simplicial complexes. In this talk, we show that it is possible to put those ideas together, by using methods of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to characterize topological phase transitions in high-order networks and complex systems.
 
Under certain conditions, topological phase transitions in networks are characterized by i) the zeros of the Euler characteristic (or the singularities of the Euler entropy); ii) the emergence of multidimensional topological holes in a network; and iii) signal changes in the mean node curvature of a network. The geometric nature of the transitions can be interpreted, under specific hypotheses, as an extension of percolation to high-dimensional objects.
 
We illustrate those ideas in functional brain networks, both in healthy and disease groups, in empirical protein interaction networks, as well as other theoretical network models. Due to the universal character of phase transitions and noise robustness of TDA, our findings open perspectives towards establishing reliable topological and geometrical fingerprints for networks. Finally, inspired by the long-term relation between topology and theoretical physics, we point at the possibility of finding high-order network analogs to this relation that have the potential to lead to basic principles in network science.</span>

                                    <span style="width:500px;">The study of motifs in networks can help researchers uncover links between structure and function of networks in biology, ecology, the social sciences, and many other fields. Empirical studies of networks have identified feedback loops, feedforward loops, and several other small structures as ``motifs'' that occur frequently in real-world networks and may contribute by various mechanisms to important functions these systems. For many of these motifs, their mechanisms are unknown. 
We propose to distinguish between ``structure motifs'' (i.e., graphlets) in networks and ``process motifs'' (which we define as structured sets of walks) on networks and consider process motifs as building blocks of processes on networks. Using as examples the covariances and correlations in a multivariate Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process on a network, we demonstrate that the distinction between structure motifs and process motifs makes it possible to gain new, quantitative insights into mechanisms that contribute to important functions of dynamical systems on networks.
